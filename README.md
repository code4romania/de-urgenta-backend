De Urgență [was prototyped](https://civiclabs.ro/ro/solutions/stay-together) in [Code for Romania](https://code4.ro/ro)'s research project, [Civic Labs](https://civiclabs.ro/ro).

The application aims to inform citizens about how to react to the first critical hours in a crisis situation (like that of an earthquake).

It also aims to build healthy habits that become ingrained with time, so that, when the critical moment arrives, each person knows what the key first steps to keeping themselves safe are.

## Development Tips

### Get started with docker-compose
1. Navigate to `/src`
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
3. Build images (optional - they will be built in step `4.` if they don't exist)
    ```bash
    docker-compose -p de-urgenta build
    ```
4. Start your containers
    ```bash
    docker-compose -p de-urgenta up -d
    ```
5. Navigate to http://localhost:5040/swagger

> we use `-p de-urgenta` to distinguish this compose project and you can skip it if you want. (it would inherit `src` otherwise - you probably have some of those already running)

> you can also specify a env file at runtime with docker-compose so you don't necessarily need to take step `2.` - more info [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/#using-the---env-file--option)
### Start a postgres server
```
docker-compose -d up postgres
```

### Creating a EF Core migration 
```
dotnet ef migrations add <Migration-name> --project DeUrgenta.Domain --startup-project DeUrgenta.Api --context DeUrgentaContext
```
### Adding EF Core migration to User.Api
```
DeUrgenta.User.Api> dotnet ef migrations add <Migration-name> --startup-project ..\DeUrgenta.Api\ -o Domain\Migrations --context UserDbContext
```
### Backend flows
```mermaid
graph TD
    Controller -- Command / Query--> Mediator
    Mediator --> CommandHandler/QueryHanlder
    CommandHandler/QueryHanlder --> IValidateRequest
    CommandHandler/QueryHanlder --> Database[(Database)]
```

```mermaid
graph
Query/CommandHandler --> Validator
    Validator --> C{Request valid ?}
    C -->|true| D[Your logic goes here]
    C -->|false| E[Result.Failure]
    D --> Database[(Database)]
```
### Configuring storage
In order to store certification photos you will need to have either Local or S3 storage configured. Toggle between these two options by setting the *StorageService* app setting to the appropriate value.

Local storage needs no additional configuration. This option is suitable for development environments.

S3 storage requires having an [AWS account configured](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-credentials.html), a bucket created and the following app settings:
```
"S3ConfigOptions": {
    "BucketName": "your-bucket-name",
    "PresignedUrlExpirationInMinutes": "10"
  }
```

### Configuring recurring jobs
Recurring jobs can be turned on or off or scheduled at different intervals by using the following configuration section in the RecurringJobs.sln appsettings.json file.
```
"RecurringJobsConfig": {
    "ExpiredCertificationJobConfig": {
      "IsEnabled": "true",
      "CronExpression": "0 0 * * *",
      "DaysBeforeExpirationDate": "30"
    },
    ...
  },
```
Every jobs will have at least the *IsEnabled* and *CronExpression* settings, but additional settings can be added as needed.

Use [crontab](https://crontab.guru/) to generate valid cron expressions.

### Using DB checkpoint for integration tests
To configure a DB to be cleaned after integration tests are run you can enable the *UseDbCheckpoint* option in the appsettings.testing.json
```
 "UseDbCheckpoint" : "true"
```
